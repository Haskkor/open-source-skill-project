# open-source-skill-project
Website project

## Purpose
Help people to invest their free time in projects that matters / projects they care about
Anyone can list their skills (dev, design, project management, analysis...) and / or submit projects

## Ideas
Projects have to be open source
Login with Github
Projects can be linked to a github repo, a Slack channel, a Trello board
Categories to sort the projects 
Projects that can have a positive impact on the world will be hightlighted
The MVP only contains a way to create a project and link it to different tools, create a user, list skills and needs
Product owner can modify the project and highlight various data (issues, pr, trello cards etc)
User can sort the projects by skills needed to find where he/she can help
